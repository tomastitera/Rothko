# Rothko Generator

This simple tool allows you to generate your very own Mark Rothko-inspired painting. 

It is built using [p5.js JavaScript library](https://p5js.org/) and some veeery basic HTML. 

You can read a short essay about whether this generator actually generates art on [my Tumblr](https://tms-ttr.tumblr.com/post/176316278730/).
